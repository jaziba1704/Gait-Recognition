# Gait-Recognition for Human Authentication

This project focuses on identifying individuals based on their walking patterns using deep learning. It extracts both 'silhouette' and 'skeleton' features from videos and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification.

# Features

- Frame extraction from video using OpenCV
- Silhouette and skeleton generation from frames
- CNN-based classification 
- Tested and trained in Google Colab
- Outputs predicted identity and confidence score

# Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
